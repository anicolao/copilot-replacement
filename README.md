# Copilot Replacement

A project to extract and replace GitHub Copilot's agentic interface functionality with a non-rate limited alternative.

## Overview

GitHub Copilot provides an agentic interface integrated into GitHub's web UI that can be effective for code generation and assistance. However, it suffers from severe rate limiting that makes it impractical for sustained development work. This project aims to:

1. Extract the core agentic functionality from GitHub Copilot
2. Make it directly usable in other projects like [Morpheum](https://github.com/anicolao/morpheum)
3. Provide a non-rate limited alternative for agentic code assistance

## Problem Statement

**Current Issues with GitHub Copilot:**
- Rate limited multiple times per day
- Interrupts development workflow
- Frustrating user experience due to unpredictable availability
- Limited to GitHub's web UI

**Goals:**
- Create a more accessible and reliable agentic coding interface
- Enable integration with external projects and workflows
- Remove rate limiting barriers to productivity
- Maintain or improve the effectiveness of agentic assistance

## Project Status

This project is in its early stages. Current work includes:
- Analyzing GitHub Copilot's agentic capabilities
- Identifying core features to replicate
- Researching alternative implementations
- Planning integration with Morpheum and other projects

## Key Features (Planned)

- **No Rate Limiting**: Unrestricted usage for development workflows
- **Portable Integration**: Can be embedded in various projects and environments
- **Agentic Capabilities**: Intelligent code generation, refactoring, and assistance
- **GitHub Integration**: Maintain compatibility with GitHub workflows where needed
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to customize and extend for specific use cases

## Use Cases

- Integration with Morpheum for enhanced development capabilities
- Standalone agentic coding assistant
- Custom development workflows requiring AI assistance
- Projects requiring sustained AI-assisted development without interruptions

## Contributing

This project is in active development. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.
